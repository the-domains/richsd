            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Illustration</h1><p>As part of his Celestial Series, Chicago-based digital artist David Brodeur rendered an alien world filled with berry-like plants, glowing crystals, and candy shaped orbs that sprout from the ground. Despite their exotic designs, Brodeur relies on common colors of familiar fruits to create this Willy Wonka-esque habitat where you can't help but want to reach out and gobble everything up.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4d6c337dd3c98bcadd87c6b27fd94f1493ae65eb.jpg"></article>]]></description>
